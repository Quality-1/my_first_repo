# my_first_repo
NLP project for predicting and analysing sentiment scores using ElasticNet regression and other linear models. Includes data preprocessing, outlier removal, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

##  Summary
This repository contains the code, data preprocessing steps, and models used in a machine learning project focused on sentiment analysis. The aim is to explore the effectiveness of different linear regression model (ElasticNet) in predicting sentiment scores from text-derived features.

##  Flagged Flight Risk Employees
Based on the analysis of negative message frequency (â‰¥4 within a 30-day window), the following employees were flagged:

1.	eric.bass@enron.com
2.	patti.thompson@enron.com
3.	sally.beck@enron.com
4.	bobette.riner@ipgdirect.com
5.	john.arnold@enron.com
6.	johnny.palmer@enron.com
7.	kayne.coulter@enron.com
8.	lydia.delgado@enron.com
9.	rhonda.denton@enron.com
10.	don.baughman@enron.com

##  Key Insights

- Most employees express negative sentiment which may be tied to job dissatisfaction or burnout.
- A subset consistently displayed positive sentiment, which might be as a result of job statisfaction
- Employees flagged as flight risks often show clustered negative sentiment shortly before exiting.

---

## Recommendations

- Proactively engage with flagged employees through one-on-one sessions.
- Use sentiment trends as early warning signals for HR intervention.
- Incorporate ongoing sentiment monitoring into employee engagement strategy.
